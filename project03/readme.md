# Situated Loop - The Goldfish Looks into You
"Goldfish Looks Into You" is an interactive multimedia installation inspired by the idea that "the abyss looks into you". In this immersive experience, participants interact with a digital environment where their actions—sounds such as clapping and laughing—trigger responsive behaviors in a group of virtual goldfish. These creatures, rendered in vivid colors and dynamic forms, not only react to the input signals but also appear to analyze the participants, creating a mutual observation and interaction scenario.

## Conceptual Framework
The installation draws on themes of surveillance, interaction, and mutual perception. It explores how human presence and activity can influence and animate a digital ecosystem, which in turn reflects and responds to human behavior, establishing a continuous loop of interaction.

## Technical Exploration
### Input Signal
**Environmental Sound Inputs:** The primary inputs for this installation are environmental sounds detected through microphones. These include varied human-generated noises like laughter, talking, and clapping.

### System Transformation
**Data Analysis Simulation:** The project utilizes the feedback system to create dynamic effects. Each goldfish is associated with a numeric display that changes based on the sounds detected. This simulates a data-analyzing process where the goldfish appear to assess the environment.

## Projector and Display Experiments
Testing different types of projectors to find the optimal resolution and brightness for displaying vivid colors and sharp images.

## Location Integration
The installation is adaptable to different spaces, with specific attention to how the placement and orientation of the projectors and sensors can enhance participant interaction.
### Location1 - Mirror
**By using the reflection of the mirror, the cycle between feedback and re-feedback is reflected.**

### Location2 - Fish Tank
**Create a more bionic environment by projecting in a fish tank to give participants an immersive experience.**
